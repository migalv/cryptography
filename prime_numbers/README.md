# Prime numbers
This directory contains the implementations to try and decipher public key based algorithms by using different cracking algorithms like LasVegas algorithm.
It also contains implementations for the calculation & estimation of prime numbers. Which is quite important for the public & private key based cipher algorithms like RSA. To acheive this I try to imitate different functions like the modpow from the gmp library and test it for time constraints to get it as close as possible.
